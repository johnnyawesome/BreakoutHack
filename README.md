## DISCLAIMER ##

The Breakout Game this cheat is for, is an OFFLINE game. It ONLY changes the LOCAL copy of the game.
Therefor, this script DOES NOT alter data on anyone's servers. You cannot even submit a highscore in this game.
This Script ONLY changes values in your browser's copy of the page, much like an adblocker does.

## Where it works: ##

The Game it's designed for is here:
https://codeincomplete.com/games/breakout/

## What the script does: ##

- **Resize your Paddle so you can't loose the Ball**
- **Speed up the Ball to lightning speed**
- **A few graphical changes**

## How to run the script

There are several possibilities to run it:
 - The easiest way is to use [TamperMonkey ](https://www.google.ch/search?q=tampermonkey) which is available for [Firefox ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) and [Chrome ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/tampermonkey), even for [Opera ](https://addons.opera.com/de/search/?query=Tampermonkey)
 ### With Tampermonkey installed,  [click here to immediately install the script! Easy! ðŸ˜‰](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/BreakoutHack/raw/master/Breakout%20Cheat.user.js)

It's also possible to run it in [Greasemonkey for Firefox ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) 
   
When you installed it and it runs, a Hack Button appears. Click it and enjoy! :)
